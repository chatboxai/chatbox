Sure! Here are three math word problems involving fractions suitable for grade 5:

### Problem 1:
Samantha made a fruit salad using apples, bananas, and grapes. She used \( \frac{2}{5} \) of a cup of apples, \( \frac{1}{3} \) of a cup of bananas, and \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a cup of grapes. How much fruit did she use in total? 

### Problem 2:

### Problem 3:
Liam has \( \frac{5}{6} \) of a pizza left from Friday, and he ate \( \frac{1}{3} \) of what he had on Saturday. How much pizza does Liam have left after Saturday?
