Certainly! Here's an example of a mathematical formula written in LaTeX:

\[
\sum_{i=1}^{n} \left( \frac{x_i}{y_i} \right)^2
\]
    
This formula represents the sum of the squares of the ratios of \(x\) to \(y\) for \(n\) terms, where \(x_i\) and \(y_i\) represent the values of \(x\) and \(y\) for each term.

LaTeX is a typesetting system commonly used for mathematical and scientific documents. It provides a wide range of formatting options and symbols for expressing mathematical expressions.
