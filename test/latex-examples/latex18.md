This is a test string without LaTeX

This is an inline LaTeX expression: \(x^2 + y^2 = z^2\)

This is a block LaTeX expression: \[E = mc^2\]

Inline \(a + b = c\) and block \[x^2 + y^2 = z^2\]

Price is $50 and $ 100

This is a valid inline LaTeX: $x^2 + y^2 = z^2$

This is a valid block LaTeX: $$E = mc^2$$

Valid $a + b = c$ and LaTeX to convert \(x^2 + y^2 = z^2\)

Price $100 and LaTeX \(x^2 + y^2 = z^2\)

This is not LaTeX: $This is just text$

Certainly! Here's an example of a mathematical formula written in LaTeX:

\[
\sum_{i=1}^{n} \left( \frac{x_i}{y_i} \right)^2
\]
    
This formula represents the sum of the squares of the ratios of \(x\) to \(y\) for \(n\) terms, where \(x_i\) and \(y_i\) represent the values of \(x\) and \(y\) for each term.

LaTeX is a typesetting system commonly used for mathematical and scientific documents. It provides a wide range of formatting options and symbols for expressing mathematical expressions.
