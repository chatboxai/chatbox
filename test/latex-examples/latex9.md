$b_k - a_k = \frac{b_{k-1} - a_{k-1}}{2} = \frac{b_0 - a_0}{2^k}$

Can you explain to me the reason why this chain of equalities is true? (please use LaTeX for math formulas)

## ASSISTANT


Let's break down the derivation step-by-step and clarify why each equality holds:

**1.  Initial Assumption (Implied):**  We're working under a recursive definition or pattern for sequences  $a_k$ and $b_k$. A crucial, though often implicit, assumption is that these sequences have a relationship where differences follow a specific pattern related to powers of 2.

**2.  Recursive Relation (Central to the Proof):** The core logic lies in assuming  a recursive formula resembling:

*  \[ b_k - a_k = \frac{1}{2}(b_{k-1} - a_{k-1}) \]

This recursive definition means each term's difference is half the difference of the previous terms.

**3.  Derivation using the Recursive Relation:**

* **From the recursive relation, we directly get:**
   $b_k - a_k = \frac{1}{2}(b_{k-1} - a_{k-1})$

* **Applying this recursively k times:**
    * Substitute $k-1$ with $k-2$, then $k-3$, and so on, until you reach the base case ($k=0$). Each time, you'll halve the difference:
    *  $b_k - a_k = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot ... \cdot \frac{1}{2} (b_1 - a_1) = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^k (b_1 - a_1)$

* **Connecting to the Initial Difference:** Since $b_0 - a_0$ is the initial difference, and we can express  $(b_1 - a_1)$ in terms of $(b_0 - a_0)$ using the recursive relation, we ultimately arrive at:
    * $b_k - a_k = \frac{b_0 - a_0}{2^k}$

**Key Points:**

* **Recursive Structure:** The proof hinges on repeatedly applying the given recursive definition for the differences.
* **Powers of 2:**  The halving process in each recursive step directly leads to the $2^k$ factor in the final result.


Therefore, the chain of equalities is a consequence of the assumed recursive pattern and the repeated application of that pattern.
